## Profile

I am a graduate student in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Yonsei University](http://yonsei.ac.kr). I work in the [Compiler Optimization Research Lab](http://corelab.or.kr), advised by Prof. [Hanjun Kim](http://corelab.or.kr/~hanjun). In addition, I worked as a visiting scholar in the [High Performance Architecture Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/) and work on the [Vortex OpenSource GPU project](https://vortex.cc.gatech.edu/).
I previously earned my B.S. in Creative IT Engineering from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr).

My research interests focus on GPU compilers, schedulers, and architecture, with a particular emphasis on graph processing and the ML/AI domain. I also have experience in high-level synthesis, neural networks for real-time systems, privacy-preserving cloud computing frameworks, and Homomorphic Encryption.

You can view my [Curriculum Vitae (PDF)](https://shin0403.github.io/files/shinnung_cv.pdf). If you're interested in my research or have any questions, feel free to reach out via email at [shin0403@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:shin0403@yonsei.ac.kr).
