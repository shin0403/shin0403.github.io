## Biography
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [High Performance Architecture Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/) and work on the [Vortex OpenSource GPU project](https://vortex.cc.gatech.edu/). I received a Ph.D. from [Yonsei University](http://yonsei.ac.kr). During my Ph.D., I worked in the [Compiler Optimization Research Lab](http://corelab.or.kr), advised by Prof. [Hanjun Kim](http://corelab.or.kr/~hanjun). I previously earned my B.S. in Creative IT Engineering from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr).  

My research focuses on GPU compilers, schedulers, and architecture, with a particular emphasis on graph processing and the ML/AI domain. I also have experience in high-level synthesis, neural networks for real-time systems, privacy-preserving cloud computing frameworks, as well as Homomorphic Encryption.
